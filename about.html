          We, as Ambassadors of Christ,
         have a mandate to CARE for the orphan and to show them God’s LOVE. 
         When God said that He is the Father to the Fatherless, 
         He was calling YOU to be that for Him! God uses His people to fulfil His purposes 
         and to bring His Kingdom to this Earth.
         Won’t you let Him use YOU so you can discover the blessing that comes from 
         allowing His infilling presence to be poured out through you into the lives of 
         these precious little ones He loves? God Needs YOU to carry His LOVE into the 
         heart of a loved-less child today! So come and serve with LOVE and CARE for
          His Little Ones and join a movement of LOVE ambassadors! We all need YOU!
